<h1>Pro Bono/Community Work</h1>
<p>Cofounder: R-Ladies Remote</p>
<p>Organiser: R-Ladies Sydney</p>
<p>I ran a Code Club from 2017- mid 2018 for a small rural school in Northern NSW. To put this into perspective for you, it was like running a dev team of 20 hyperactive squirrels. Other exciting parts included the time a kid bought a whole jar of spiders to class. Once, a kid bought in a baby rat they found.</p>
<p>It was the country, what can I tell you? The internet is dreadful, but the wildlife and the people are superb.</p>
