# Introduction

R is a dynamic, vibrant programming language, going from strength to strength. Originally created by Ihaka and Gentleman in the 1990s, what was a niche experimental language is now in mainstream world-wide usage across many disciplines and domains (Ihaka, 1998).

One thing that Ihaka and Gentleman may not have intended at the time was the fact that R is no longer _just_ a programming language. It's developing into a distinct subculture at the intersection of multiple different fields and domains. This places it in a unique position, both to benefit from those fields and domains and to influence them.

This piece argues that not only is R a developing subculture, that being a subculture it can transmit and develop ideas that have a fundamental economic value beyond the coded output it enables. This piece also argues that not only does R as a subculture engender _value_, it creates, develops and demands _values_. A subculture developing in R does not just develop and transmit _ideas_, it transmits an _ideaology_, one that has the potential to reach well beyond the fields and domains of its userbase.

# Not just a language

R is a programming language with two decades of development. In parallel to that programming development, community development has not only kept pace, but expanded rapidly in recent years. The R community is not bounded by any single institution, group or communication platform. While there are large and distinct groups such as ROpensci, R-Ladies and user groups on every continent (with the possible exception of Antarctica, but give them time) in addition to diverse Twitter and StackOverflow communities: none of these wholly encompass the R community.

These communities, however, share commonalities and crossovers that go beyond the programming language itself. They share distinctive patterns of behaviour, beliefs and mores. These should not be construed as a wholly _homogeneous_ set of beliefs and behaviours: indeed, there are many differences between them. Anheier et al. (2009) note that subcultures can exist at all levels of organisations. In other words, [xkcd was right, it's fractal all the way down](https://xkcd.com/1095/). However, they share distinctive traits that tie them together. 

If we take the definition of a subculture as per Hodkinson (2012), these distinctive traits are _extra-ordinary in their location within the parameters and environment of unusually concentrated and often defiant communities centred on sets of styles and practices which, in some respects, are spectacular and distinctive and are understood as such both by insiders and outsiders._ In the context of R, these are distinctive traits applied by others collectively _("the R community is ...")_ as well as proudly championed in the community, for example, R's own language quirks, notably championed by its assignment operator <-.

The elements of the shared R lifeworld include:

__Shared institutions.__ There are a number of institutions that R users regularly share with, participate in or benefited by. These include institutions critical to the functioning of R as a programming language, such as the R Core group, CRAN (Centralised R Archive Network) and the R Foundation. However, participants in the developing subculture are not limited to these institutions: many R users attend local meetups and/or are involved in a remote community either through Twitter, StackOverflow or some other platform. Others in addition may identify with certain groups or ideologies such as R-Ladies, the Tidyverse (a complex subcultural phenomenon in itself) or other community, like the R for Data Science learning community.

__Distinct philosophical and well developed ideaological concepts__. While not espoused or recognised by every member of the community: many members grapple with, embrace or dispute certain philosophies (most notably _'the tidyverse'_), they nonetheless engage with it. Intellectual constructs like the _layered grammar of graphics_ (Wickham, 2010) or the _grammar of data manipulation_ (Wickham et al., 2017) contribute to overall meta constructs of programming and data agency. Indeed, there is a substantial differential of opinon within the developing subculture, which paralells the experience Coleman (2012) observed among 'hackers' in the Debian project:

 _Once we recognise the intimate connection between hacker ethics and liberal commitments *and* the diversity of ethical positions, it is clear that hackers provide less of a unitary and distinguishable ethical position, and more of a mosaic and interconnected, but at times divergent ethical principles._ 

__Content developed for and by the subculture__. The developing subculture produces more content than code for the use of analysts and analysis produced by R code. The developing subculture produces, both for its own consumption and those outside of it:

    * Visualisation as art both deliberately (see for example [the R Graph Gallery, Holtz (2017)](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/portfolio/data-art/) or [Flowing Data (Yau, 2018)](http://flowingdata.com)), and accidentally, shared for appreciative purposes (see for example [accidental aRT (Woo and Mudrak 2018)](http://accidental-art.tumblr.com)).
    * Analysis for entertainment and general education, for example Robinson's (2016, 2017) [analysis of Trump's tweets](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) and [Meek and Averick (2017)](https://archervisualization.herokuapp.com) (although the site was built in D3, analysis was also conducted in R).
    * Extensive educative materials and communities both for R, the programming language (see for example Bocek (2018), Maegan (2018) among many others), for the dynamic package sharing system, [such as Silge (2017)](https://juliasilge.com/blog/navigating-packages/) and for navigating the community itself, [such as Ellis (2017)](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/23/community/).
    * Meta cultural content, created for the purpose of alerting the subculture to these resources, such as [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com), [R Weekly](https://www.rweekly.org), and many others
    
This developed lifeworld is not unique to R as a developing subculture among programming languages. The seminal work of Coleman (2012) first noted the development of a rich open source subculture within the Debian project. Coleman noted in particular the interplay between two competing ideaologies, those of individualism and collectivism, within the 'hacker' subculture, as exemplified by the Debian project.

She noted: _The belief in the value of individuality coupled with the constant need for the help of other hackers points to a subtle paradox that textures their social world. The tension between individualism and collectivism, in particular, is negotiated through the extremely well-developed and common penchant that hackers have for performing cleverness, whether through technological production or humor_

A point which many participants in the R community will find familiar: particularly as to the common occurence of cleverness through technological production and humour _at the same time_ (see for example Averick and Meeks 2017).

Does a distinct developing R subculture matter? If so, what does it _mean_? 

# With subculture comes value

OUTLINE:

- A subculture is more than just a programming language. It brings value to the process of creation that extends beyond satellite programmers sitting alone and coding in paralell.
- A subculture absorbs ideas from the outside, evolves them and generates new ones, the sends them out. This has real, intrinsice value.
- The development of this subculture is driving development in R and vv.
- The fact that R as a community/subculture has a very unique array of inputs is not surprising.
- This subculture is at the intersection of a very broad array of fields and provides a communication medium for them, as well as a marketplace for the exchange of ideas.

- The array of outputs from this subculture is extraordinary.
  - First stage outputs: improvements and add ons to R itself. Things like packages, utilities etc.
  - Second stage outputs: scientific, statistical and humanities work built in part using first stage outputs.
  - Third stage outputs: taking these scientific + other research outputs to create other objects of value in the community - business, government, scientific endeavour in the comunity etc.
  - Obviously lots of interplay between stages and they're neither consecutive or necessarily required. One piece of work can encompass all three.
- Why does this matter? Because productivity matters. Productivity is one of the ways that we can increase living standards for everone over all.
- What is productivity?
- Productivity has been lagging in the developed world [chart], but it's not even across industries by any means.
- The fact that open source has _value_ is not new, e.g. Debian, Microsoft's opposition to _FOSS_. But it's not just the technology that is being created that is valuable: it's an evolutionary tourney of ideas that a subculture gives rise to.

Being at the intersection of multiple academic disciplines (stats, ecology, bio, econ, engineering, comp sci, sociology/politics etc etc), schools of thought (e.g. sciences, econs, humanities) as well as practioners (academics, students, business, government) means an incredible confluence of ideas.

These compete with and interact with one another, developing nuances, branches and new ideas themselves. This is inherently valuable.

The value that's being driven by this tourney of ideas can be considered in three different types as a rough typology:

    * methodological sharing. A data scientist, trained from an econometrician can learn about the biological concept of an evolutionary tourney from a computer science professor 500km away. Business can pick up and start using a broad away of scientific methods very quickly thanks to FOSS. The public good that is research _works_. 
    * idea sharing. The concepts of reproducibility make for better science, for better decision making and tracking over all. The accountability inherent in those concepts means that no matter who we are, we own the responsibility of our anlaysis and that's important (build on that later).
    * strategy sharing. Shared and devloping concepts around workflows, professionalising software development management techniques and programmign skill in paralell with statistical/methodological skill contribute a more robust workforce with a broader outlook, doing better, faster and more productively.

- A number of these R culture outputs translate into very substantive economic value further down the chain, just by the productivity increases they engender for users. They may seem prosaic, but because of the number of people they can help and apply to, they're huge!
- Some of the ideas that have been developed + championed (not in isolation) in the R community include

    * Viz. Cite ggplot2 + patchwork, cowplot, many others. Shiny!
    * workflows. examples from mundane/minor/obvious to some Rachel Meager's [advice on filenames](https://twitter.com/economeager/status/997077103483981825), this gets propagated through the community regularly and never fails to pick up many who never heard it before. To Jenny Bryan's tour de force on workflows. Cite googlesheets, readxl, happy git with R etc.
    * interoperability - two groups: talk to other languages, read other data. [Ursa](http://wesmckinney.com/blog/announcing-ursalabs/), reticulate, rJava, rcpp, tabulizer
    * documentation importance- increase the use of these tools for everybody. Understanding that documentation that works for _me_ doesn't work for everyone. Blog posts, _emojis_ all of these are critical tools for communication. Break down barriers!
    
- Not the only things that are important, but these four prosaic things have had a profound impact on the way we work and will continue to work into the future. in an industry/group of people that are providing leadership into the future it's profoundly influential. Truly decentralising a workforce. 

Important to remember no subculture exists or works in isolation.

Influenced from the outside, but even a relatively small one can influence right back. That's what R is doing.


# With subculture comes _values_

OUTLINE:

- A subculture transmits not just _ideas_ but _ideaology_.

- A unique place in time and in our broader super culture for data nerds right now.
- Unique place for data nerds in history - we are influential, we are able to exert power on the way our world is changing. We are able to provide a nuanced view as a comnmunity. The power of a subsculture is that you can have multiple diverging view points about a single thing.

- As a subculture we are aware of both the _value_ of the new, as well as the need for _values_ to utilise the new fairly. 

    * Can explore the confluence of consequences. E.g. [building code to kill people](https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/media), as expressed by Caleb Thompson and drawn by Stephanie Nemeth.
    * Data values, e.g. [data based policing](https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21742151-over-third-those-named-it-have-no-serious-convictions-database-suspected-london?frsc=dg%7Ce) [and the corollary in the US from the subculture](https://twitter.com/defsophiaray/status/996151795629125633) @defsophiaray - python user!.


- R as a subclulture transmits _value_, but it also transmits its _values_:

    * A place for new people
    * open source
    * diversity and difference
    * ethics
    * reproducibility
    
The value of this outside the subculture has a strong historic precedent, c.f. Coleman again and again:
    - G. Coleman: _By turning Linux and open source into household names, many more people learned about not just open source but also the ethical foundations—sharing, freedom, and collaboration—of free software production. In other words, historical outcomes proved to be more unpredictable, complex, and ultimately ironic than anyone could have ever imagined._
    - G. Coleman: _Over ten years of active development and use of free software, a critical mass of hackers had inculcated not simply a commitment to their craft but also a well-developed ethos for information freedom and sharing that ran aground against developments in intellectual property law._

- But this is not a homogeneous world view. It's one that comes with a certain level of unavoidable friction.
    - G. Coleman: _Over ten years of active development and use of free software, a critical mass of hackers had inculcated not simply a commitment to their craft but also a well-developed ethos for information freedom and sharing that ran aground against developments in intellectual property law._
    - _"Once we recognize the intimate connection between hacker ethics and liberal commitments and the diversity of ethical positions, it is clear that hackers provide less of a unitary and distinguishable ethical position, and more of a mosaic of interconnected, but at times divergent, ethical principles."_ from "Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking" by E. Gabriella Coleman

- We have to decide which values matter to us, which ones will be put out to the world.
- There is no opt-out, they're there whether we acnknowledge them or not. 
- We should debate rigorously amongst ourselves the impacts of our work outside our little life world that's R
0 * life world: technical term.
- We should also think deeply and talk about how we want to shape this lifeworld.



Coleman: _Guiding this practice is the idea that the free software project represents an endeavor that far exceeds any single person’s efforts, and thus everyone’s contribution is highly regarded, whether it involves filing a bug report or offering a significant, large-scale innovation._

Coleman: _On the other hand, hackers often express a commitment to self-reliance, which can be at times displayed in a quite abrasive and elitist tone. The most famous token of this stance is the short quip “Read the Fucking Manual” (RTFM)._

Coleman: _Unlike academics—who at times religiously guard their data or findings until published, or only circulate them among a small group of trusted peers—hackers freely share their findings, insights, and solutions._
