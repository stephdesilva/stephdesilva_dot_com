<p>I had the opportunity to talk at the CPA Emerging Leaders Conference today in Melbourne, then again next week in Sydney. It was a great crowd with a really interesting mix of perspectives.</p>
<p>I was talking about <em>Creating data driven value and insights</em>, which was aimed at showing an already very data literate group of people (accountants!) how to get started with data driven thinking.</p>
<p>My thoughts on getting started come down to five things:</p>
<pre><code>* Viz early, viz often (make charts, lots of them!)
* Value can come from aggregation ([@Nicole Radziwill](https://twitter.com/nicoleradziwill) on twitter framed this perfectly)
* Domain knowledge matters (even if you bring in a battery of data scientists, you know your business better than outsiders do)
* Think about where the uncertainty lies
* Calculate to communicate</code></pre>
