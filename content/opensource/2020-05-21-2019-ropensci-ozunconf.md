So 2019 was ... big. And I didn't touch the blog all year.

But that didn't mean there was no open source happening. I was the program chair of the [ROpenSci OzUnconference](https://ozunconf19.ropensci.org).

I did blog about what an amazing team we had and the extraordinary projects we put together. You can read about that on the [rOpenSci blog in detail](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/02/05/ozunconf19/). And when I said it was a tough time for Australia back in December ... hoo boy did I have no clue.
