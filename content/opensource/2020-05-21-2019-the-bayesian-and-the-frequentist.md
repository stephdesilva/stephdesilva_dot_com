Another of my beloved projects that got very little attention last year.

Are new years' resolutions in late May allowed?

[The Bayesian and the Frequentist](https://www.thebayesianandthefrequentist.com) is the brainchild of [John Ormerod](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=8C2lfj0AAAAJ&hl=en), Associate Professor of Stats @ University of Sydney and myself. 

What happens when you put together a corporate data scientist and an academic statistician. We're not really sure what to call it.

But it's definitely something I'm going to get back into this year. FOR SURE.
