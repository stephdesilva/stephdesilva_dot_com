I often take on pro bono work for organisations that need help developing a data strategy or delivering a data science project. The kinds of things I do for not for profits include advice on research design, analysis, modelling, or training data analysts.

I may not always be able to say yes, but if you're a not for profit or research group who need a hand, please don't hesitate to ask. 

If I can't help, I may be able to help you find someone who can.
