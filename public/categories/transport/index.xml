      <description>I started a new job last week. On day 2, the boss said to me “What do you know about transport and GIS?”, to which I gamely replied (with more honesty than career sense) “nothing!”
So here I am working on transport and GIS.
She who brags about being a fast learner in interviews reaps what she sows.
As it turns out, both transport and GIS are awesome. But how do you get up to speed really, really quickly?</description>
