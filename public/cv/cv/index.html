<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>An experienced data scientist with a diverse background and a strong technical skill set, I have experience working both internationally and domestically in industries such as development, telecommunications and finance.</p>
<p>A keen statistical programmer, I will be a keynote speaker at the useR! conference in Brisbane in July 2018.</p>
</div>
<div id="education" class="section level1">
<h1>Education</h1>
<p><strong>Master of Computer Science (Current)</strong></p>
<p>I’m currently exploring forecasting in high dimensional data sets and exploring whether agent-based (AI) approaches can provide a robust method of managing massive numbers of time series with a view to submitting a masters’ thesis on the topic.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor of Philosophy 2004-2008</strong></p>
<p>Research focused on finding practical, but theoretically robust solutions for testing complex time series models over multiple dimensions (panel data).</p>
<p><strong>Bachelor of Arts/Commerce 1998-2003</strong></p>
<p>Honours in Econometrics (first class – game theory). Additional majors in Economics, Latin and Ancient History.</p>
</div>
<div id="work-experience" class="section level1">
<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<p><strong>Data Science Consultant and Strategist</strong></p>
<p><em>Rex Analytics / 2014 - 2018</em></p>
<p>At Rex Analytics, we provided the missing link for companies with a data focus, but still developing a deep data expertise. Some (but not all) of the projects I worked on include:</p>
<pre><code>* The Connecting Regional Communities Program, providing advice, analysis and visualization to the Victorian Government around digitization of regional communities.
* Workflow by Design, a project with a management consulting firm developing a workflow for a rapidly expanding data science consulting practice.
* Providing data strategy and insights for a late-stage startup.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Econometrician</strong></p>
<p><em>Department of Communications and the Arts / July - December 2016</em></p>
<p>As a part of this short term contract I contributed to two projects: the regional telecommunications database and was a co-author on the Chief Economist’s major work on the impacts of digitization on productivity. Using Shiny/R, I designed a user interface which allowed departmental users to generate automated reporting. I also provided data visualisation, time series models and growth statistics for the productivity project.</p>
<p><strong>Unit Coordinator/eLearning Advisor</strong></p>
<p><em>Swinburne Online / 2015 – 2017</em></p>
<p>I taught for Swinburne’s MBA and MPA programs in finance and economics, as well undergraduate units such as statistics, marketing and business innovation. I take a team of students of varying abilities through a challenging semester of technical work, building on their skills and confidence. I’ve taken courses previously rated by students at 5/10 to greater than 8/10 in a single semester.</p>
<p>In order to get my team through the semester, I build interactive apps, design infographics and deliver online content while having fun with it. One of my favourite hobbies!</p>
<p><strong>Econometrician</strong></p>
<p><em>The World Bank / 2012 – 2015</em></p>
<p>At the World Bank, I worked with the Pacific education team and was responsible for the management of survey and data analysis, modelling and report writing. I provided support for intervention evaluation design, sample design and implementation, in-country support for teams during data collection and entry. I worked on projects from Laos, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Vanuatu, Timor Leste, Myanmar and Cambodia.</p>
<p>In 2014, I travelled to Laos to provide statistical support to the Research Institute located in the Ministry of Education in Laos. I co-authored six major World Bank reports and provided statistical/econometric support for many more. In Stata, I developed multi- equation system models for categorical outcomes (classification), including logit, tobit and regression models. Power calculations, RCT evaluation/design, and probabilistic sampling and testing were also in my remit.</p>
<p><strong>Casual Lecturer, Associate Lecturer, Research Assistant</strong></p>
<p><em>The University of Sydney / 2004 – 2009</em></p>
<p>I taught and researched advanced data science concepts such as time series modelling and forecasting, classification models, probabilistic theory, applied econometrics and data analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="technical-skills" class="section level1">
<h1>Technical Skills</h1>
<p>My preferred languages right now: R, Python, Java.</p>
<p>Languages/platforms I’ve worked in previously or have experience with: SQL, Fortran, Gauss, Stata, SPSS, HTML/CSS, Javascript.</p>
</div>
<div id="pro-bonocommunity-work" class="section level1">
<h1>Pro Bono/Community Work</h1>
<p>Cofounder: R-Ladies Remote</p>
<p>Organiser: R-Ladies Sydney</p>
<p>I ran a Code Club from 2017- mid 2018 for a small rural school in Northern NSW. To put this into perspective for you, it was like running a dev team of 20 hyperactive squirrels. Other exciting parts included the time a kid bought a whole jar of spiders to class. Once, a kid bought in a baby rat they found.</p>
<p>It was the country, what can I tell you? The internet was dreadful, but the wildlife and the people are superb.</p>
</div>
<div id="language-skills" class="section level1">
<h1>Language Skills</h1>
<p>I have a degree in Classical Latin. There are two things about this that are relevant to data science/consulting:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I’m great with communication and language</li>
<li>One day the Vatican will require some kind of analytics <em>and it will be my moment.</em></li>
</ol>
