[You can find my publications list here.](https://www.steph.ai/publications/publications/) I write/research alot less in management consulting...  but I'll get back to it one of these days.


# Language Skills

I have a degree in Classical Latin. There are two things about this that are relevant to data science/consulting:

(1) I'm great with communication and language
(2) One day the Vatican will require some kind of analytics _and it will be my moment._
