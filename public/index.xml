      <description>Automating a consulting project workflow There’s been a great deal of really useful work around data science workflows in the last couple of years and if you’ve followed Jenny Bryan’s work at all, you’ll know exactly what I mean.

      <description>Summary An experienced data scientist with a diverse background and a strong technical skill set, I have experience working both internationally and domestically in industries such as development, telecommunications and finance.
A keen statistical programmer, I will be a keynote speaker at the useR! conference in Brisbane in July 2018.
 Education Master of Computer Science (Current)
I’m currently exploring forecasting in high dimensional data sets and exploring whether agent-based (AI) approaches can provide a robust method of managing massive numbers of time series with a view to submitting a masters’ thesis on the topic.</description>

      <description>If you’re a rural data scientist, then sooner or later you’ve had to move a big file to the cloud or back. That’s a world of pain right there.
If you know anything about how information is transmitted via the internet, you know that files are broken into packets, sent, then reassembled on the other side. If packets go missing, the computer requests resends until the file is fully assembled, or until the system times out.</description>

      <description>I often take on pro bono work for organisations that need help developing a data strategy or delivering a data science project. The kinds of things I do for not for profits include advice on research design, analysis, modelling, or training data analysts.
I may not always be able to say yes, but if you’re a not for profit or research group who need a hand, please don’t hesitate to ask.</description>
