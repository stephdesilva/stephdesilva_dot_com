<h1>Not just a language</h1>
<p>R is a developing subculture, as well as a developing, dynamic programming language.</p>
<p>This subculture is at the intersection of a very broad array of fields and provides a communication medium for them, as well as a marketplace for the exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>Evidence of culture:</p>
<pre><code>* Coleman&#39;s _Hacker Culture_ observed specificaly in Debian open source communities. E.g. not unique to R.
* HOdkinson&#39;s spectacular and distinctive points
* Anheier et al. point about existing at all levels of an org, e.g. there&#39;s not one monolithic set of R &#39;thoughts&#39;, but many subs within subs.
* Heidegger&#39;s R as an object and a thing
* Tension between individualism and collectivism as per Coleman. Talk about gatekeeping as an outcome.? (Maybe next section).</code></pre>
<p>G. Coleman, COding Freedom: <em>Once we recognise the intimate connection between hacker ethics and liberal commitments <em>and</em> the diversity of ethical positions, it is clear that hackers provide less of a unitary and distinguishable ethical position, and more of a mosaic and interconnected, but at times divergent ethical principles.</em></p>
<p>G. Coleman: <em>the awareness of a shared social commonwealth takes on a decidedly moral character, leading some developers to reappraise their virtual interactions and behavior with fellow developers.</em> (Behaviour at conferences)</p>
<p>G. Coleman: <em>Signs of sameness are everywhere. Most people are attached to their computers, and share a common language</em> (Conf behaviour)</p>
<p>Hodkinson, 2012: <em>- At the very least, subcultural friendships, consumption, collecting, dancing and so on remain extra-ordinary in their location within the parameters and environment of unusually concentrated and often defiant communities centred on sets of styles and practices which, in some respects, are spectacular and distinctive and are understood as such both by insiders and outsiders.</em></p>
<p>G. Coleman: _ What really grabbed me was the community. That was what really grabbed me, and you have to understand at the time, it was a completely foreign notion._ p. 42</p>
<p>G. Coleman: <em>the awareness of a shared social commonwealth takes on a decidedly moral character, leading some developers to reappraise their virtual interactions and behavior with fellow developers.</em></p>
<p><em>Subcultures can exist at all levels of organizations, highlighting the fact that there are multiple cultures or value combinations usually evident in any one organization that can complement but also compete with the overall organisational culture.</em> p11 Anheier, Helmut K., Stefan Toepler and Regina List, eds., International Encyclopedia of Civil Society, (Springer, 2010)</p>
<p>Coleman: <em>Indeed, hacking, like all social domains, is shot through with a series of notable tensions. These oscillate between individualism and collectivism, elitism and humility, and frustration and deep pleasure, among others. There are various codes—informal and formal—by which hackers negotiate the tensions that characterize their productive landscape.</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>The belief in the value of individuality coupled with the constant need for the help of other hackers points to a subtle paradox that textures their social world. The tension between individualism and collectivism, in particular, is negotiated through the extremely well-developed and common penchant that hackers have for performing cleverness, whether through technological production or humor</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>Hackers assert a form of individualism that valorizes self-expression and development among peers engaged in similar acts of technological production, while tightly entangled with each other through constant collaboration.</em></p>
<p>Coleman on r as both object and thing: <em>In Heidegger’s cartography, an object strikes its users as familiar and beyond the scope of critical awareness. Its social meaning is held in place through regular patterns of use and circulation. But when we misuse an object (a spoon used as a knife or a can opener utilized as a hammer) or when an object malfunctions, its thingness is laid bare in the sense that its material characteristic becomes evident.</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>A complicated set of norms and conventions surround asking for help. They depend on the social context of the query and who is asking the question.</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>The use of RTFM is disputed as well. During the 2005 Debian project leader election, the issue of documentation erupted during a mailing list debate. The subject of RTFM rebukes was broached directly. One developer argued that RTFM is an inflammatory, unproductive response to newcomers who may find themselves confused and overwhelmed with Debian’s technical and procedural complexity. To make new users feel welcome, he believed that developers should refrain from replying with RTFM, and instead focus their efforts on achieving greater transparency and accessibility.</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>meritocratic order based on expertise fundamentally requires others for constant evaluation as well.</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>though hackers tend to approach other hackers as equals, they also construct themselves as high-tech cognoscenti creating the bleeding edge of technology.</em></p>

<div id="with-subculture-comes-value" class="section level1">
<h1>With subculture comes value</h1>
<p>A unique array out outputs from this subculture is both broad and rich.</p>
<p>A number of them translate to very substantive economic value, even if estimating that would be difficult.</p>
<p>A subculture absorbs ideas from the outside, evolves them and generates new ones, the sends them out. This has real, intrinsice value.</p>
<p>Some of the ideas that have been developed + championed (not in isolation) in the R community include</p>
<pre><code>* Viz. Cite ggplot2 + patchwork, cowplot, many others. Shiny!
* workflows. examples from mundane/minor/obvious to some Rachel Meager&#39;s [advice on filenames](https://twitter.com/economeager/status/997077103483981825), this gets propagated through the community regularly and never fails to pick up many who never heard it before. To Jenny Bryan&#39;s tour de force on workflows. Cite googlesheets, readxl, happy git with R etc.
* interoperability - two groups: talk to other languages, read other data. [Ursa](http://wesmckinney.com/blog/announcing-ursalabs/), reticulate, rJava, rcpp, tabulizer
* documentation importance. </code></pre>
<p>Not the only things that are important, but these four prosaic things have had a profound impact on the way we work and will continue to work into the future. in an industry/group of people that are providing leadership into the future it’s profoundly influential. Truly decentralising a workforce.</p>
<p>Important to remember no subculture exists or works in isolation.</p>
<p>Influenced from the outside, but even a relatively small one can influence right back. That’s what R is doing.</p>
<p>The fact that open source has <em>value</em> is not new, e.g. Debian, Microsoft’s opposition to <em>FOSS</em>. But it’s not just the technology that is being created that is valuable: it’s an evolutionary tourney of ideas that a subculture gives rise to.</p>
<p>Being at the intersection of multiple academic disciplines (stats, ecology, bio, econ, engineering, comp sci, sociology/politics etc etc), schools of thought (e.g. sciences, econs, humanities) as well as practioners (academics, students, business, government) means an incredible confluence of ideas.</p>
<p>These compete with and interact with one another, developing nuances, branches and new ideas themselves. This is inherently valuable.</p>
<p>Examples of value:</p>
<pre><code>* methodological sharing. A data scientist, trained from an econometrician can learn about the biological concept of an evolutionary tourney from a computer science professor 500km away. Business can pick up and start using a broad away of scientific methods very quickly thanks to FOSS. The public good that is research _works_. 
* idea sharing. The concepts of reproducibility make for better science, for better decision making and tracking over all. The accountability inherent in those concepts means that no matter who we are, we own the responsibility of our anlaysis and that&#39;s important (build on that later).
* strategy sharing. Shared and devloping concepts around workflows, professionalising software development management techniques and programmign skill in paralell with statistical/methodological skill contribute a more robust workforce with a broader outlook, doing better, faster and more productively.</code></pre>

<div id="with-subculture-comes-values" class="section level1">
<h1>With subculture comes <em>values</em></h1>
<p>A subculture transmits not just <em>ideas</em> but <em>ideaology</em>.</p>
<p>A unique place in time and in our broader super culture for data nerds right now.</p>
<p>The development of this subculture is driving development in R and vv.</p>
<p>Unique place for data nerds in history - we are influential, we are able to exert power on the way our world is changing. We are able to provide a nuanced view as a comnmunity. The power of a subsculture is that you can have multiple diverging view points about a single thing.</p>
<p>As a subculture we are aware of both the <em>value</em> of the new, as well as the need for <em>values</em> to utilise the new fairly.</p>
<pre><code>* Can explore the confluence of consequences. E.g. [building code to kill people](https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/media), as expressed by Caleb Thompson and drawn by Stephanie Nemeth.
* Data values, e.g. [data based policing](https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21742151-over-third-those-named-it-have-no-serious-convictions-database-suspected-london?frsc=dg%7Ce) [and the corollary in the US from the subculture](https://twitter.com/defsophiaray/status/996151795629125633) @defsophiaray - python user!.</code></pre>
<p>R as a subclulture transmits <em>value</em>, but it also transmits its <em>values</em>:</p>
<pre><code>* A place for new people
* open source
* diversity and difference
* ethics
* reproducibility</code></pre>
<p>The value of this has a strong historic precedent:</p>
<p>G. Coleman: <em>By turning Linux and open source into household names, many more people learned about not just open source but also the ethical foundations—sharing, freedom, and collaboration—of free software production. In other words, historical outcomes proved to be more unpredictable, complex, and ultimately ironic than anyone could have ever imagined.</em></p>
<p>G. Coleman: <em>Over ten years of active development and use of free software, a critical mass of hackers had inculcated not simply a commitment to their craft but also a well-developed ethos for information freedom and sharing that ran aground against developments in intellectual property law.</em></p>
<p><em>“Once we recognize the intimate connection between hacker ethics and liberal commitments and the diversity of ethical positions, it is clear that hackers provide less of a unitary and distinguishable ethical position, and more of a mosaic of interconnected, but at times divergent, ethical principles.”</em> from “Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking” by E. Gabriella Coleman</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.asia/8NAg14E" class="uri">http://amzn.asia/8NAg14E</a></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>Free software projects, while most famous as the place where technical coordination unfolds, is also where significant ethical work transpires. It is here where commitments to free speech are inculcated, thorny issues of meritocracies are resolved, and hackers embody and live out a dense ethical practice.</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>Although we might be able to identify some indisputable commitments among hackers, such as meritocracy and the form of individualism it entails, the foundation of value among hackers is never without dispute and friction.</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>Largely by way of F/ OSS philosophy, hackers laud mutual aid and cooperative reciprocity as vital features of technical collaboration. They spend an inordinate number of hours helping each other. But there is also an elitist stance that places an extremely high premium on self-reliance, individual achievement, and meritocracy. 8 While the populist stance affirms the equal worth of everyone who contributes to an endeavor, the elitist one distributes credit, rewarding on the basis of superior accomplishment, technical prowess, and individual talent—all judged meticulously by other hackers.</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>Guiding this practice is the idea that the free software project represents an endeavor that far exceeds any single person’s efforts, and thus everyone’s contribution is highly regarded, whether it involves filing a bug report or offering a significant, large-scale innovation.</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>On the other hand, hackers often express a commitment to self-reliance, which can be at times displayed in a quite abrasive and elitist tone. The most famous token of this stance is the short quip “Read the Fucking Manual” (RTFM).</em></p>
<p>Coleman: <em>Unlike academics—who at times religiously guard their data or findings until published, or only circulate them among a small group of trusted peers—hackers freely share their findings, insights, and solutions.</em></p>
