I had the opportunity to talk at the CPA Emerging Leaders Conference today in Melbourne, then again next week in Sydney. It was a great crowd with a really interesting mix of perspectives.

I was talking about _Creating data driven value and insights_, which was aimed at showing an already very data literate group of people (accountants!) how to get started with data driven thinking.

My thoughts on getting started come down to five things:

    * Viz early, viz often (make charts, lots of them!)
    * Value can come from aggregation ([@Nicole Radziwill](https://twitter.com/nicoleradziwill) on twitter framed this perfectly)
    * Domain knowledge matters (even if you bring in a battery of data scientists, you know your business better than outsiders do)
    * Think about where the uncertainty lies
    * Calculate to communicate
    
[My slides for the talk are hosted on Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/stephdesilva/creating-data-driven-value-and-insights#) if you're interested.
